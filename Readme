To do real-time object detection in Python, you need to use YOLO, a deep learning algorithm, and OpenCV, a computer vision library. You also need to install PyTorch and Ultralytics. You can find some code examples in these links: [Real-time Object Tracking with OpenCV and YOLOv8 in Python], [realtime-object-detection], [YOLO-Real-Time-Object-Detection].
Real-time object detection is the task of detecting and locating objects of interest in an image or video stream in real time. It is a challenging problem that requires both high accuracy and high speed. There are many applications of real-time object detection, such as security, surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.

One of the most popular and effective methods for real-time object detection is YOLO (You Only Look Once), which is a deep learning-based algorithm that can process images in a single pass and output bounding boxes and class labels for each detected object. YOLO is fast, accurate, and easy to use. There are several versions of YOLO, such as YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv8.

In order to use YOLO for real-time object detection in Python, you need to install some Python packages, such as OpenCV, PyTorch, and Ultralytics. OpenCV is a library for computer vision and image processing. PyTorch is a framework for deep learning and neural networks. Ultralytics is a repository that provides pre-trained models and code for YOLO.

To perform real-time object detection with YOLO and OpenCV in Python, you need to follow these steps:

- Import the required packages
- Initialize the video capture object
- Load the pre-trained YOLO model
- Loop over the frames of the video stream
- Preprocess the frame and feed it to the YOLO model
- Get the predictions from the model and filter them by confidence threshold
- Draw bounding boxes and labels on the frame
- Display the frame or save it to a video file
